## Customer Order Payment Validation Summary

### Changes Made to `/src/app/orders/page.js`:

1. **Enhanced Input Validation**:
   - Modified the "Deposited Amount" input field to prevent entering amounts greater than the total order amount
   - Added real-time validation that shows alert when user tries to exceed total amount
   - Added red border styling when amount exceeds total
   - Added error message below input field when amount is invalid

2. **Updated Submit Function**:
   - Changed validation logic to prevent submission when deposited amount exceeds total
   - Added clear error message for invalid amounts
   - Modified partial payment handling to show warning for amounts less than total
   - Removed old logic that allowed any amount with confirmation

3. **Enhanced Submit Button**:
   - Submit button is now disabled when deposited amount exceeds total
   - Added visual feedback with disabled styling

4. **Real-time Payment Summary**:
   - Added dynamic payment validation summary that shows:
     - ⚠️ Invalid Amount (red) - when amount exceeds total
     - ⚠️ Partial Payment (yellow) - when amount is less than total, shows remaining balance
     - ✅ Full Payment (green) - when amount matches total exactly

### Key Features:
- **Prevents over-payment**: Users cannot enter amounts greater than order total
- **Real-time feedback**: Immediate validation and visual cues
- **Partial payment support**: Allows partial payments with clear warnings
- **User-friendly**: Clear error messages and visual indicators
- **Secure**: Submit button disabled for invalid amounts

### User Experience:
- Users get immediate feedback when trying to enter invalid amounts
- Clear visual indicators (colors, icons, messages) guide user behavior  
- Submit button prevents accidental submission of invalid amounts
- Supports both full and partial payments with appropriate warnings

This implementation ensures that customers cannot submit payment receipts with deposited amounts exceeding the order total, while still allowing legitimate partial payments with proper warnings.
